/**
Build a "like button" component using React 16.
The component should be the default export (use export default).

Requirements:
1. There should be a like button:
    - The content of the like button should be in the following format:
      "Like | 100", where 100 is the total number of likes.
    - It should have a "like-button" class.
    - Wrap the number of likes in a span with a "likes-counter" class.
    - The initial number of likes in the counter should be 100.

2. Users can add a like. By clicking the button:
    - The number of likes should increase by one.
    - Like button should have "liked" class in addition to the "like-button"
      class (you can use the classnames tool for that).

3. Users can undo their like by clicking again on the button:
    - The counter should decrease by one.
    - "liked" class should be removed.

Assessment/Tools:
    - Only two imports are allowed: react (v16.8.6) and classnames (v2.2.5).
      Both are at the top of the starting code.
    - Use the animation below as a reference for your solution.
    - Design/styling is not assessed and will not affect the score.
      You should focus only on implementing the requirements.
    - The "Preview" tab will display your component.
      You can use it for testing purposes.
